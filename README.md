# Lab08 - Analyze Data with Transact-SQL in Azure Synapse Analytics

## üìò Overview

This lab is part of the **DP-203: Data Engineering on Microsoft Azure** certification. You will learn how to use Transact-SQL (T-SQL) in **Azure Synapse Analytics** to explore and analyze large volumes of data. The lab focuses on advanced querying techniques including **aggregation**, **window functions**, and **approximate aggregations**.

---

## üõ†Ô∏è Prerequisites

- Active Azure subscription
- Azure Synapse Analytics workspace and dedicated SQL pool (sqlxxxxxxx)
- Access to Synapse Studio
- Sample data already loaded (e.g., `FactInternetSales`, `DimDate`, `DimGeography`, etc.)

---

## üìå Purpose  
This lab focuses on analyzing sales data stored in a data warehouse using fact and dimension tables. You'll explore database schemas, write analytical queries, and manage Azure resources efficiently.

---

## 2. View Database Tables  

### üéØ Why?  
To understand the schema of the data warehouse and distinguish between **fact** and **dimension** tables.

---

## ‚≠ê 3. Examine Fact and Dimension Tables  

Data warehouses typically include two types of tables:

- **Fact Tables**  
  Store measurable data used for numerical analysis.  
  _Examples: `FactInternetSales`, `FactResellerSales`_

- **Dimension Tables**  
  Contain descriptive attributes related to facts.  
  _Examples: `DimProduct`, `DimCustomer`, `DimTime`, `DimGeography`_

---

## üéØ 4. Introduction to Data Warehouse Queries  

### Objective  
Analyze internet sales from the `FactInternetSales` table using various dimensions such as time, geography, and product.

### Tasks  
- Join `FactInternetSales` with appropriate dimension tables (e.g., `DimTime`, `DimProduct`, `DimGeography`).
- Group and summarize total sales.
- Save and **publish** your query script.
- Rename the script to:  
  **`Analyze Internet Sales`**

---

## üéØ 5. Challenge: Reseller Sales Analysis  

### Create a new script:  
**`Analyze Reseller Sales`**

### Write SQL queries to analyze the following:

1. **Total quantity of items sold per fiscal year and quarter.**
2. **Total quantity of items sold per fiscal year, quarter, and sales territory** associated with the employee who made the sale.
3. **Total quantity of items sold per fiscal year, quarter, and sales territory region by product category.**
4. **Rank of each sales territory per fiscal year** based on total sales amount.
5. **Approximate number of sales orders per year in each sales territory.**

---

## üßπ 6. Clean Up Azure Resources  

To avoid incurring further costs:

1. Go to the **Resource groups** section in the Azure portal.
2. Select the resource group used for this lab.
3. Click **Delete resource group**.
4. Confirm the resource group name and proceed with deletion.
